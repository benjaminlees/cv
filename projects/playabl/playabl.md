### An android and Iphone football game

After working at founders and coders for a few months on various projects I decided to go into contracting to gain a bit of experience working in a larger team.

At Playabl I was involved in building a android and iphone game in JavaScript, html and css using Cordova. The game, Predictabl, is an exclusive prediction game for clubs including Monoco, Wolves and many more.
