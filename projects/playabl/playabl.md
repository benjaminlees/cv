### An android and Iphone football game

After working at founders and coders for a few months on various projects I decided to go into contracting to gain a bit of experience working in a larger team.

At [Playabl](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playabl) I was involved in building a android and iphone game in JavaScript, html and css using Cordova. The game, (Predictabl)[https://asmonaco.playabl.com/fr-fr/], is an exclusive prediction game for clubs including Monoco, Wolves and many more.
