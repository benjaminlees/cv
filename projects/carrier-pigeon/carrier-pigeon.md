### An Inventory Management System

After contracting at Playabl I decided to come back to Founders and Coders to work on an open source inventory management system for a freight company.

The system is now integral to the workings of the business and contains a lot of functionality including:

- Invoice System
- Orders System
- Reminder Functionality
- Contacts System
- Multiple Permissions

### Landing Page
The book icon resembles a invoice which changes colour when an invoice is made.

### Booking Request
Email and print an automatically generated booking request.
