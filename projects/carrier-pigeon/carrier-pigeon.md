### An Inventory Management System

After contracting at Playabl I decided to come back to founders and coders to work on an open source inventory management system for a freight company.

The system is now integral to the workings of the business and contains quit allot of functionality including:

- Invoice System
- Orders System
- Reminders Functionality
- Contacts System
- Multiple Permissions

### Landing Page
The book icon resembles a invoice which changes color when an invoice is made.
