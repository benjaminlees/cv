# CV - Benjamin Lees

I have a Masters in Civil Engineering, and I enjoy solving real world problems using applied mathematics. During my degree I was introduced to programming and taught myself C#. After my degree I joined the Founders and Coders co-operative where I learnt web development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Node.js. When the  course finished I was involved in launching its agency division, and began teaching as  well as working as a developer.
